# Persest

Persest is a Windows Post-Exploitation persistence
tool.

## Why this project?

I have created this project, to learn to program in C and focus the learning towards the branch, which I like the most, which is cybersecurity. The project is still very green and in the process of development.

The persistence part through executable malware and service creation is still under development.

Several things need to be polished, since I am new to the language.
